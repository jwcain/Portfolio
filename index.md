# About Me

Hi, I am Justin. I am a [Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu/cs/) graduate with a B.S. in Software Engineering and an aspiration to break into the video game development industry. I have been a hobbyist developer since I was 10, with my only regret being how many projects I’ve deleted.

I served 3 years in the [Husky Game Development Enterprise](https://www.huskygames.com/) at MTU. In my second year, I served as VP of Operations within the enterprise. As VP, I managed our weekly general meetings which usually involved giving a lecture on relevant game development topics. In my third year, I stepped down to take leadership over a game development project.

I was awarded a scholarship by my enterprise to attend [GDC2018](https://www.gdconf.com/). There, I embraced the game development community and decided to move beyond hobbyist development and build a career in the field.

In the summer of 2018, I had an internship with a startup game studio. There I worked as the solo code developer, working primarily off of a GDD and the input of the creative director.

Some of my favourite video games include Overcooked, The Talos Principle, Fallout: NV, and Minecraft. I am also an avid tabletop gamer; I host a weekly DnD campaign, attend Friday Night Magic every single week I can, and have an ever growing board game collection.
