# About Me

Hi, I am Justin! I am a [Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu/cs/) graduate with a B.S. in Software Engineering and an aspiration to break into the video game development industry. I have been a hobbyist developer since I was 10, with experience primarily focusing on general gameplay development and AI.

I worked for 3 years in the [Husky Game Development Enterprise](https://www.huskygames.com/) at MTU. In my second year, I served as Vice President of Operations within the enterprise. As VPO, I managed our weekly general meetings which usually involved lecturing on relevant game development topics. In my third year, I stepped down to take leadership over a game development project.

I was awarded a scholarship by my enterprise to attend [GDC2018](https://www.gdconf.com/).

In the summer of 2018, I had an internship with a startup game studio, Coney Dog Games.

Some of my favourite video games include Overcooked, The Talos Principle, Slay the Spire, Celeste, and Minecraft. I am also an avid tabletop gamer; I host a weekly DnD campaign, attend Friday Night Magic every week I can, and have an ever growing board game collection.



> “Justin was proactive, enthusiastic and multi-talented. That enthusiasm continued throughout the entire internship. Looking back at our interview and hiring process, I would absolutely make the same decision in taking Justin on as a team member. He is  a valuable asset, with good insight and work ethic.”
